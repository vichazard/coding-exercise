## Dev Setup

Follow the steps here to create your Supabase backend from the staging environment.

https://supabase.com/docs/guides/resources/supabase-cli/local-development

For development, all you need to do is [install the Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) and then run
`supabase start` in the root directory. _You don't have to run `supabase login` to start the project!_

Once supabase is started and running, it will print out some information. Make note of the `API URL`, the `anon key`,
and `service_role key`.

### Running the tests

These are integration tests and it will spin up Supabase automatically for you. Because of this, it is recommended to
run the tests in watch mode.

Copy the `@app/tests/.env.example` file to `@app/tests/.env`.

```bash
cp @app/tests/.env.example @app/tests/.env
````

Then run this at the root of the project:

```bash
yarn install
yarn test --watch
```

### FAQ

**Q: How do I test/debug RLS policies?**

**A:** This can be tested within a postgres transaction after setting a variable to emulate what supabase does during
their connections. Open a query console in DataGrip and run the following:

```postgresql
begin; -- Start the transaction
set role authenticated; -- Necessary to enable RLS policies otherwise none would
set local "request.jwt.claims" to '{ "sub": "5284a300-3a7a-4840-bb70-3d8dafa8d9a3", "email": "email@disca.tech" }'; -- Emulate a specific user
select auth.uid(); -- This should return the user id if working properly.
select * from users; -- An example of querying a table that might have RLS policies enabled
commit; -- End the transaction
```

```postgresql
begin;
set role postgres; -- Dont forget to set the role back if you changed it outside the transaction.
commit;
```

If you need to debug the actual RLS policies themselves, the easily way is to edit the method being called itself.

```postgresql
create or replace function public.owns_record(user_id uuid, out success boolean) returns boolean as $$
begin
    raise notice 'auth.uid %', user_id;
    raise notice 'user_id  %', user_id;
    select auth.uid() = user_id into success;
end;
$$ language plpgsql stable set search_path = pg_catalog, public, pg_temp;
```
